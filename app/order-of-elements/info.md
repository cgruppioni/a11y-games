website as long, long, telephone menu
tabs in logical order, with skips where helpful
one-column view first, best for:
- people using mobile devices
- people using zoom
- people who appreciate a "distraction-free" mode

use a grid system.... or flexbox/css grid!!!
don't use flex-order, or use it very cautiously (it's unlikely that tab-order or AT navigation order will come along for the ride)
