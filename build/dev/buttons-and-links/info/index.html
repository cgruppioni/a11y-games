      <p>Did you know that buttons and links (anchor tags) are intended for different purposes, and shouldn't be considered interchangeable?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Links are for navigating to content.</li>
  <li>Buttons are for everything else. They are for triggering actions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other">One of these things is not like the otherâ€¦</h2>

<p>When navigating a web page by keyboard, people normally use the <strong>spacebar</strong> to press a button. They use <strong>enter/return</strong> to follow a link. Pressing spacebar on a link might accidentally scroll your browser window; pressing enter on a button might accidentally submit a form.</p>

<p>Following a link makes a new entry in your browser's history, changes the address in your URL bar, and navigates the browser to new content  (unless a developer does a lot of work to supress that behavior). Pressing a button doesn't (unless a developer does a lot of work to recreate all that behavior).</p>

<p>Assistive technology, just like search engines, often gives people a list of all the links on a page, so that they can more quickly navigate to the content they are interested in. Meaningless entries for button-triggered actions shouldn't clutter that list; links that are styled to look like buttons shouldn't be absent from that list.</p>

<p>(Plus, if assistive technology can't find your links, chances are search engines can't either. Honoring the button/link distinction improves both your accessibility and your SEO!)</p>

<p>Learn more about links and buttons from web accessibility expert <a href="https://marcysutton.com/links-vs-buttons-in-modern-web-applications/">Marcy Sutton</a> and from <a href="http://www.last-child.com/keyboard-accessibility-with-the-space-bar/">:last-child</a>.</p>

<h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>

<p>Whenever you can, simply use <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;button type="button"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code> if you require a button (or <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;button type="submit"&gt;</code> etc.) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;a href="..."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> if you require a link. They work, right out of the box.</p>

<p>But sometimes your hands are tied. You might not have complete control over your markup. Your design might call for a button that looks like a link, or a link that looks like a button, and you might not be sure how that can be accomplished (at least without a ton of work). You might be obligated by contract, court order, or black magic to restrict yourself to <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;span&gt;</code> elements.</p>

<p>If you have to get creative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure all anchor tags have non-empty href attributes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure any spans, divs, or other elements that don't normally receive keyboard focus are assigned a tabindex of 0, so they are entered into the tabbing flow in the natural order.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure any non-button tags used as buttons have role="button", to increase the likelihood that assistive technology will behave appropriately. (Your mileage may vary, depending on your particular browser and your particular assistive technology.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use javascript to force the element to behave as expected. Do the expected keys trigger the desired action? Does any unexpected behavior take place? Is anything missing?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
